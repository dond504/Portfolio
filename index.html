                <h2 class="intro-head">Hello, I am Donald !</h2>
                <p>Most of my friends call me Don and if you are reading this feel free to call me Don for short.
                    I am born and raised in the greatest city in the world New Orleans, Louisiana! Once you have visited
                    New Orleans you will not want to go home.</p>
                <p>Currently I am a Uber/Lyft driver in New Oleans. I am also a very proud single parent of a 16 year
                    old
                    daughter that i raised all by my self since she was 4 years old. That right there makes me awesome!
                    I also like to travel, ride rollercoasters, play video games and cruise. This darn pandemic has
                    caused
                    me to make a career change and coding is the wave and I am about to ride it!
                </p>

                    <h2 class="about-head">About me</h2>
                    <p>Knowing that coding and technology is the way of the future, now I
                        can take advantage of diving into coding and web design. I dabbled a
                        little in web disign before and found it to be fun and exciting but life
                        wouldn't let me go deeper. Now that the oppurtunity is available I would
                        like to inspire people and or make something life changing for someone!
                    </p>
                    <p>In a team or solo wouldn't bother me too much as long as I worked in an
                        environment where I wouldn't have to wear that cow uniform everyday. Working
                        with other developers would be a fun time banging ideas back and forth with
                        each other and sharing that satisfaction of completion with co-workers would be
                        great!</p>
                    <p>If you read this far and couldn't figure out that I have a good personality and
                        great sense of humor well.... I like doing fun things with fun people. Group
                        trips are fun and I have some bucket list items i need to do. I want to learn
                        to surf, ski, and jump out a perfectly moving plane once.
                    </p>
                    <p>Here is a list of services I would like to provide my clients:</p>
                    <ul class="about-list">
                        <li>Professional, clean code for every request givin.</li>
                        <li>Provide creative web design ideas and implement them on a live application.</li>
                        <li>Provide a creative and fun experience that will go beyond a customer client relationship.
                        </li>

                        a store. The skills used will be full stack development.</p>
